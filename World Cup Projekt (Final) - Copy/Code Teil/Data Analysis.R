### Checking which player scored the most goals in the history of the WC:

head(goals)
head(players)
# Group the data by the player_id 
goals_grouped <- group_by(goals, player_id)

# printing out for each player how many goals he scored (by first transforming the group_by func into a table then a new df to join with another df)

### Checking which player had the most red cards
head(bookings)

red_cards_by_name[!duplicated(red_cards_by_name), ]
#-> Zidane and Rigobert have received the most red Cards in WC history (2)



#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Checking which team had the most WCs and which team made it the most to top 4

# Checking the df
head(tournament_standings)

# Extracting only the champions from each wc from the df

champions_df <- tournament_standings %>% filter(position == 1)

## Checking the team that made it the most to the top 4 (semi final)
head(tournament_standings)

# Replacing west germany to germany

### The Player with the most appearances 
head(player_appearances)
players <- player_appearances %>% select(player_id, family_name, given_name)

### checking the biggest stadiums from the wc (capacity wise)
head(stadiums)

head(stadium)
stadium <- stadium %>% arrange(desc(stadium_capacity))
head(stadium)
# -> it used to have 200000 capacity, but due to renovations it has been reduced

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Checking out the data about the Host winning the World Cup
head(tournaments)
nrow(tournaments)
tournament <- tournaments %>% select(tournament_name, winner, host_country, host_won)
head(tournament)
# how many times did the host win the wc

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Checking how many teams from represented its continent's  confederation/association
head(teams)
team <- teams %>% select(team_name, confederation_name)
head(team)

# grouping the table by the different confederations

confederation <- group_by(team, confederation_name)
region <- table(confederation$confederation_name)

# sorting (or arranging) the df by how many teams represented the different confederations in the wc
head(df_regions %>% arrange(desc(n))) #absteigende Reihenfolge
# plotting
